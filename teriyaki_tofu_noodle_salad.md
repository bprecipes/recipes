Teriyaki tofu noodle salad
=========

Teriyaki sauce

 * 80 ml / 1/3 cup soy sauce or tamari
 * 120 ml / ½ cup cooking sake / dry sherry or water
 * 120 ml / ½ cup mirin
 * 50 g / ¼ cup sugar or agave / maple syrup, adjust to taste

Remaining ingredients
-----------
 * 400 g / 14 oz firm or extra firm tofu, pressed
 * 30 ml / 2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
 * 200 g / 7 oz udon, soba or flat rice noodles
 * 200 g / 7 oz tenderstem broccoli, chopped small
 * 3 spring onions / scallions
 * 130 g / 1 cup edamame, ready-to-eat or frozen
 * 15 ml / 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil and / or chilli oil
 * 10 ml / 2 tsp rice wine vinegar
 * sesame seeds, to decorate

Teriyaki sauce
-----------
 0. Combine all the ingredients in a small pot and bring them to a simmer. If using sugar, stir until the sugar has dissolved completely. Simmer, uncovered, on a low heat until the sauce has reduced and thickened (SEE NOTES) – it will take approximately 15-20 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool down completely before using, it will thicken as it cools.

Directions
---------
 0. Cut pressed tofu into equal size cubes (mine were 2 cm / 3/4”). Mix soy sauce with 1 tbsp of water in a medium bowl, add tofu cubes and allow them to marinate until all of the liquid has been absorbed. You can skip this step if you wish, but I do this so that the tofu is seasoned all the way through.
 1. Thread tofu cubes onto 4 metal or wooden skewers. If using wooden skewers on a BBQ make sure to soak them in water 30 minutes prior to using. To make sure all the tofu pieces touch the pan / BBQ grill, it’s best to thread them on a flat surface.
 2. Place tofu skewers on a preheated griddle pan or a moderately hot (white coals) BBQ. Allow them to cook until char marks develop before turning to another side.
 3. Once your tofu has cooked on all sides, brush it liberally with teriyaki sauce (you may want to reapply it during cooking) and return to the BBQ or place under a hot grill / broiler if cooking this at home. Cook briefly, until the marinade has caramelised a little but not burned (it contains sugar so will burn easily).
 4. Cook noodles according to package instructions and refresh under a cold tap.
 5. Steam, grill or stir-fry broccoli, white and white-green parts of the spring onions chopped roughly (slice green parts finely and save them for garnish) and steam or stir-fry edamame (if using frozen). If grilling broccoli and spring onions, toss them in a small amount of neutral oil before placing on a grill or a griddle pan.
 6. Combine 2 tbsp of teriyaki sauce with toasted sesame and / or chilli oil and rice vinegar. Season to taste with more soy sauce if needed. Stir through the cooled noodles.
 7. Arrange dressed noodles, cooked broccoli, edamame and spring onions on a platter. Garnish with spring onion tops and sesame seeds and drizzle with extra sauce if desired. Serve with tofu skewers on the side.
