Tomato and Cheddar Tart with a Savory Parmesan Crust
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 3 large eggs
 * 3/4 cups milk
 * 1/2 tsp kosher salt
 * 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper
 * 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar, shredded
 * 2 large tomatoes, sliced

Crust
-----------
 * 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
 * 1/2 tsp kosher salt
 * 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper
 * 1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese
 * 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cubed
 * 3 tbsp cold ice water

Directions
---------
 1. In a large bowl combine the flour, salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese.
 2. Add the butter to the flour and work the mixture between your fingers, breaking down the pieces of butter until the flour and butter is nice and crumbly. No large pieces of butter should remain.
 3. Slowly drizzle in a tbsp at a time of ice cold water, stirring with a wooden spoon as you go. With one hand, gently knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together. Flatten into a disc and wrap with Saran wrap. Place into the fridge for 30 minutes.
 4. Preheat the oven to 425ºF.
 5. Remove the dough from the fridge. Lightly flour a clean work surface, and roll out the dough into a circle - roughly 12 x 12 inches. Lay the dough onto a 9 inch tart pan. Press the dough flat into the bottom and then up the sides of the pan. Trim away any excess dough. Place the tart shell back into the fridge while you make the filling.
 6. In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper with a wire whisk.
 7. Remove the tart shell from the fridge and layer the bottom with shredded cheese.
 8. Pour the egg mixture on top, then top with the sliced tomatoes. Sprinkle the top with a little extra salt and pepper.
 9. Place the tart onto a baking sheet and place in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 °F and bake for an additional 45 minutes or until the quiche is cooked through the center.
 10. Remove from the oven and let cool. Serve warm or cold.
