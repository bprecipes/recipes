Sesame Balsamic Tofu Bowls With Chile Mango
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 1 lb firm tofu, sliced into 26-32 slabs (see note)
 * 1/4 cup soy sauce or gluten-free tamari
 * 2 T balsamic vinegar
 * 2 T olive oil
 * 1 T sesame oil
 * 1 T maple syrup
 * 1 T sriracha

Chile Mango
-----------
 * 2 mangoes, peeled, pitted and cut into chunks
 * 2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar
 * generous pinch aleppo pepper flakes
 * pinch sea salt

Sunflower Cilantro Pesto
-----------
 * 1/2 cup cilantro leaves, loosely packed
 * 1/2 cup roasted, unsalted sunflower seeds (shelled)
 * 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
 * juice of 1 orange
 * salt to taste

For Serving
-----------
 * cooked rice or other grain of choice
 * sauteed leafy greens (such as a mix of kale, cabbage and shredded Brussel sprouts)
 * sunflower and/or sesame seeds, for topping

Directions
---------
 1. Arrange tofu in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet (foil-lined, if you prefer simpler clean-up). Combine remaining tofu ingredients and pour over. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, flipping tofu halfway if you have the chance.
 2. When tofu has marinated, preheat broiler. Broil tofu 8-10 mins, until browned and slightly puffy. Flip, broil another 6-8 mins, watching tofu closely to avoid burning. Allow to cool slightly.
 3. While tofu is broiling, combine all mango ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
 4. Combine cilantro and sunflower seeds in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add oil, juice and salt and process until a loose paste forms (like, uh, pesto).
 5. Portion rice or grain and sauteed veggies across bowls. Top with tofu and mango; scatter seeds over top. Serve pesto over top or alongside for dipping and mixing in as you eat. Enjoy!
