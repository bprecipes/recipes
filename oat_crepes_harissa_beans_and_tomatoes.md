Oat Crepes with Harissa Beans and Tomatoes
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 60g oat flower
 * 2 large eggs
 * 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
 * 1/2 cup (120ml) milk 
 * 1 tablespoon butter (12g), melted and cooled

Whipped Feta
-----------
 * 1 1/2 ounces (40g) feta cheese
 * 2 tablespoons (5g) cream cheese, softened 
 * 2 tablespoons (20g) whole milk

Tomatoes
-----------
 * 1 teaspoon (4g) to 1 tablespoon (12g) harissa paste (see note)
 * 2 tablespoons (24g) unsalted butter
 * 1 cup (90g) sliced cherry tomatoes
 * 1/2 cup (115g) cooked white beans, drained of any liquid (and rinsed if using canned)
 * Salt, to taste

Directions
---------
 0. To the oat flour add in the eggs, salt, milk, and butter and wisk to combine
 1. Heat 8″ skillet over medium-low heat and lightly grease with butter. Place a scant ¼ cup of batter in pan. Tilt/swirl the pan so that the batter covers the entire bottom of the pan in a thin layer. 
 2. Cook for about 30 to 60 seconds, until the edges begin to peel away from the sides of the pan and look golden. Flip and cook for another 20 to 30 seconds.
 3. Once the crepes finish, crumble the feta into a bowl and add the cream cheese and milk. Stir to combine, then whip vigorously to lighten the mixture slightly.
 4. Finally, melt the butter in a small pan and add the harissa. Cook just to warm. Toss the tomatoes with the white beans and the harissa butter. 
 5. Spread the feta mix evenly into four crepes, fold, and top with the tomato mix. Sprinkle with the basil and serve.

Notes
---------
 * Often doubled
 * Fine with just plain feta
