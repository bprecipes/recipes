Roasted Winter Bowl with BBQ Tempeh & Hemp Seed Ranch
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 1 small-medium sweet potato, (about 3/4 lb or 330 grams) peeled + diced into 1/2 inch cubes
 * 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
 * 1/3 of a block of tempeh, from a standard 1/2 lb or 250 gram block, cut into 2-inch pieces
 * 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce of choice (see notes)
 * 7-8 brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered

Hemp Seed Ranch (makes extra)
-----------
 * 1/2 cup raw + hulled hemp seeds
 * 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from approximately 1 lemon)
 * 1/4 cup water
 * 1 tablespoon olive oil
 * 1 teaspoon dijon mustard
 * 1 teaspoon garlic powder
 * 1/4 teaspoon nutritional yeast
 * 1 green onion, finely minced (approximately 1/4 cup)
 * 1 sprig of dill, chopped (approximately 1 tablespoon)
 * sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste

Directions
---------
 1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Set out a large baking sheet, lining it with parchment paper if you like.
 2. Make the hemp seed ranch dressing. In a blender, combine the hemp seeds, lemon juice, water, olive oil, dijon, garlic powder, nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper. Whizz the mixture on high until you have a smooth and creamy texture. Scrape the dressing into a small bowl and stir in the green onions and dill. Cover the dressing and store in the refrigerator.
 3. Place the diced sweet potatoes onto one end of the baking sheet. Toss the sweet potatoes with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil, some salt and pepper. Slide the sheet into the oven and set your timer for 15 minutes.
 4. At the 15 minute mark, remove the baking sheet. In a small bowl, toss the tempeh pieces with another teaspoon of olive oil, some salt and pepper. Arrange the tempeh pieces in the middle segment of the baking sheet. Lightly toss the sweet potatoes. Slide the sheet back into the oven and set your timer for another 15 minutes.
 5. At the 15 minute mark, remove the baking sheet. Throw the brussels sprouts into the same small bowl that you used for the tempeh. Toss the brussels sprouts with the remaining olive oil, salt, and pepper. Scatter them in a single layer on the remaining segment of the baking sheet.
 6. Flip the tempeh pieces over and brush them with the barbecue sauce. Slide the sheet back into the oven for 15 more minutes. Once brussels sprouts are lightly browned, remove baking sheet from the oven.
 7. Transfer sweet potatoes, tempeh, and brussels sprouts to a serving bowl. Drizzle some of the hemp seed ranch dressing over top and enjoy.
