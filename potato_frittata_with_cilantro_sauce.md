A Tasty Frittata
=========

Cilantro Chile Sauce:
-----------
 * 2 large cloves garlic
 * 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
 * 2 tablespoons lemon juice, freshly squeezed
 * 1 small bunch cilantro
 * 1 green (serrano) chile, seeds removed
 * 2 pinches ground cumin
 * a couple big pinches of salt

Frittata:
-----------
 * 6 large organic eggs
 * 1 tablespoon olive oil
 * 1 small yellow onion, chopped
 * 3 small potatoes, very very thinly sliced
 * 1/2 cup yellow zucchini or cauliflower,1/2-inch pieces
 * 1/4 cup goat cheese, crumbled
 * 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds, toasted
 * couple pinches of salt

Directions
---------
 0. Preheat your oven to 450F degrees. Make the cilantro chile sauce by pureeing the garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, cilantro, chile, cumin, and salt until very smooth. Taste and add more salt if needed. Set aside.
 1. In a medium bowl whisk the eggs with a small pinch of salt. Set aside. In a (small) 8 1/2-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat add the olive oil, onion, and another pinch of salt. Saute, stirring constantly, until the onion starts to brown, 5 - 7 minutes. Add the potatoes and zucchini (or cauliflower), cover, and cook for another 3 minutes or so. Slide everything out of the skillet onto a plate and set aside.
 2. Turn down the heat a bit. Using the same skillet, add the eggs and cook over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes or until the eggs are just set and there isn't a lot of liquid running around the pan. To facilitate this, run a spatula underneath the sides of the frittata and tilt the pan so the uncooked eggs run to the underside and cook. Drizzle the eggs with a few tablespoons of the cilantro chile sauce, now sprinkle the potato onion mixture over the top.
 3. Place the skillet in the oven and bake for about 9 minutes, or until well set and puffy. Add a crumble of goat cheese and the pumpkin seeds across the top of the frittata in the final 2 minutes of baking. Remove from oven (be careful the handle is hot!), cut into wedges and serve.
