Crunchy Thai Peanut & Quinoa Salad
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 3/4 cup uncooked quinoa
 * 1 1/2 cups water
 * 2 cups shredded purple cabbage
 * 1 cup grated carrot
 * 1 cup thinly sliced snow peas or sugar snap peas
 * 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
 * 1/4 cup thinly sliced green onion
 * 1/4 cup chopped roasted and salted peanuts, for garnish

Peanut sauce
-----------
 * 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter
 * 3 tablespoons reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
 * 1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey
 * 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
 * 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
 * 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
 * 1/2 lime, juiced (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)
 * Pinch of red pepper flakes

Directions
---------
 0. Cook the quinoa: In a medium-sized pot, combine the rinsed quinoa and 1 Â½ cups water. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer the quinoa until it has absorbed all of the water. Remove the quinoa from heat, cover the pot and let it rest for 5 minutes. Uncover the pot and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Set it aside to cool.
 1. Meanwhile, make the peanut sauce: Whisk together the peanut butter and tamari until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and whisk until smooth. If the mixture seems too thick to toss into the salad, whisk in a bit of water to loosen it up.
 2. In a large serving bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, shredded cabbage, carrot, snow peas, cilantro and green onion. Toss to combine, then pour in the peanut sauce. Toss again until everything it lightly coated in sauce. Taste, and if it needs it add a pinch of salt and toss again. Divide into individual bowls and garnish with peanuts.
