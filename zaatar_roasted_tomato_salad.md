Za’atar Roasted Tomato Salad with Black Lentils
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 2 cups cherry tomatoes (I prefer more)
 * Small eggplant
 * 2 teaspoons olive oil
 * 1 tablespoon za’atar
 * 2 teaspoons olive oil
 * 1 medium shallot, minced
 * 1/2 cup uncooked black lentils
 * Salt, to taste
 * 1 bunch, 8 oz, kale
 * Pinch of salt
 * 1 ounce crumbled feta

Directions
---------
 1. Preheat oven to 400˚F. Halve the cherry tomatoes and toss with olive oil. Peel and cube eggplant into quarter inch cubes and toss with olive oil. Place tomatoes and eggplant on different sides of tray. Roast until the tomatoes are starting to wilt and lightly brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, stir in the za’atar, and return to the oven for 5 minutes.
 2. Heat a medium pot over medium-low heat. Add the 2 teaspoons olive oil then the shallot. Cook until the shallot is tender, 4 to 5 minutes Stir in the lentils and cover with 1 ¼ cup water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the lentils are tender and the water is mostly absorbed, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in a pinch of salt, leave covered, and let sit for 5 minutes.
 3. While the tomatoes and lentils cook, remove the stems from the kale. Roughly chop the kale and place in a bowl. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and massage the salt into the kale. Let the kale sit until ready to assemble the salad.
 4. Assemble the salad with the massaged kale, roasted tomatoes, lentils, and feta. Drizzle with a bit lemon vinaigrette and toss until combined and salad is coated, adding a bit more dressing as needed. Serve with an extra sprinkle of za’atar if desired.
