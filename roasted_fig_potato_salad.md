Roasted fig + potato salad with asparagus, goat cheese + honey-orange balsamic vinaigrette
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * ½ lb dried figs, such as Mission, stems trimmed
 * 2 cups hot brewed fruity, floral white tea (I used this Pomegranate White Tea with Hibiscus)
 * 1 lb fingerling potatoes (or other small, waxy potato), halved lengthwise
 * ¼ cup olive oil
 * 1 head garlic, cloves whole and peeled
 * 5-6 sprigs thyme
 * salt and pepper, to taste
 * 6 large handfuls arugula
 * 6-8 oz asparagus, trimmed
 * 4 oz goat cheese, crumbled

Dressing
-----------
 * 1/4 cup olive oil
 * 3 T orange juice
 * 3 T good balsamic vinegar
 * 1 T honey (or maple syrup)
 * 1 T sweet-hot mustard (I'm loving this one at the moment)
 * 1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
 * salt and pepper

Directions
---------
 1. In a medium bowl, pour hot tea over dried figs. Bring to room temperature, then cover, refrigerate and allow to soak 2-6 hours or overnight (depending on the softness of your dried fruit), until slightly plumped and soft but with a bit of chew.
 2. Preheat oven to 400F. Drain figs (discard tea) and toss with potatoes, garlic cloves, thyme and plenty of salt and pepper. Arrange on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer and roast until potatoes are golden, tossing once, about 30 mins.
 3. Meanwhile, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Bring a shallow pan of water to a boil. Salt water and add asparagus, cooking only until bright green, about 60-90 seconds. Remove asparagus to ice water to stop cooking. Drain.
 4. Whisk or shake together all dressing ingredients.
 5. Lightly dress arugula with vinaigrette, tossing to combine. Divide arugula among serving plates (or pile into large serving dish) and top with roasted potatoes, figs and garlic cloves. Add asparagus (either trimmed into bite-sized pieces or whole spears) and goat cheese over the top. Serve with additional dressing and more salt and pepper, to taste. Enjoy!
