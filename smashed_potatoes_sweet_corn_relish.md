 * 1/2 cup finely diced green bell pepper
 * 2 tablespoons minced jalapeno

 * 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
 * 1 to 1 1/4 cup frozen peas
 * 1/2 teaspoon minced, seeded, minced jalapeño
 * 1/4 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed
 * Freshly ground white pepper

Smashed potatoes, onions, and assembly
-----------

 * 1/2 cup peanut or a vegetable oil
 * 2 large yellow onions, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
 * Kosher salt
 * Freshly ground black pepper


Make the Sweet Corn Relish
---------
 0. Place the corn kernels, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, jalapeño, and garlic in a 1-quart jar, or divide between 2 1-pint jars, and set aside. 
 1. In a pot, combine the vinegar, 1/4 cup water, sugar, mustard and cumin seeds, salt, peppercorns, and turmeric and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until the liquid is hot to the touch and the sugar has completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. 
 2. Pour the liquid over the corn mixture and let cool. Refrigerate the relish for at least one day to develop the flavor, or up to 1 year.

Make the Spicy Spring Pea Sauce
---------
 0. In a medium pot or saucepan, bring 1 quart water to boil over high heat. Add 2 teaspoons of the salt and gently pour the peas into the pot. Blanch until just tender, about 3 minutes, or up to 4 minutes if they were frozen. 
 1. Drain the peas in a colander and rinse with cold water. Transfer the peas to a blender. 
 2. Add 1/4 water to start, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, the jalapeño, and the lemon juice and puree until smooth, adding remaining 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary (the mixture should be viscous but pour fairly easily from the blender). 
 3. Pour the pureed peas into a serving bowl. Season more salt, white pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

Make the Smashed Potatoes and Caramelized Onion Rings
---------
 * Fit a large pot with a steamer insert and fill with 2 inches of water. Put the potatoes and in the steamer, cover, and cook over medium heat until fork-tender, about 35 to 45 minutes, adding more water to the pot if necessary. Remove the potatoes from the steam and let cool for 5 minutes.
 * While the potatoes are steaming, warm 1/4 cup of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Reduce the heat to low and add the onion slices, keeping them intact. Cook, gently stirring and flipping as needed for even cooking, until just starting to caramelize, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and set aside. Leave any extra oil behind in the pan.
 * On a clean work surface, gently press each potato with the palm of your hand to flatten it to about 1/2-inch-thick. Set aside. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. In the same large skillet where you cooked the onion slices, add the remaining 1/4 cup oil over medium-high heat. Add half the potatoes in a single layer and cook until crispy and browning, about 5 minutes. Salt the potatoes, gently flip them, and fry for 4 to 5 minutes more. Salt the second side and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining potatoes.
