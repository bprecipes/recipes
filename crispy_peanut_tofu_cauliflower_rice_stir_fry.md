Crispy Peanut Tofu & Cauliflower Rice Stir Fry
=========

Ingredients
---------
 * 12 ounces (340 g) extra firm tofu
 * 1 Tbsp (15 ml) Toasted sesame oil
 * 1 small head cauliflower (~ 580 g)
 * 2 cloves garlic, minced (1 Tbsp or 6 g)

Sauce
---------
 * 1.5 Tbsp (15 ml) Toasted sesame oil
 * 1/4 cup (60 ml) low sodium soy sauce
 * 1/4 cup (55 g) honey
 * 1/2 tsp chili garlic sauce
 * 2.5 Tbsp (40 g) peanut butter or almond butter

Extras
---------
 * Veggies (baby bok choy, green onion, red pepper, broccoli)
 * Toppings: Fresh lime juice, cilantro, sriracha

Instructions
---------
 1. Begin by draining tofu 1.5 hours before you want your meal ready. If your block of tofu is larger than 12 ounces, trim it down. You don’t need a full pound for this recipe (see notes).
 1. Roll tofu in an absorbent towel several times and then place something heavy on top to press. I use a pot on top of a cutting board and sometimes add something to the pot to add more weight. Do this for 15 minutes.
 1. Near the end of draining, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and cube tofu. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and arrange in a single layer. Bake for 25 minutes to dry/firm the tofu. Once baked, remove from oven and let cool.
 1. Prepare sauce by whisking together ingredients until combined. Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I often add a little more sweetener and peanut butter.
 1. Add cooled tofu to the sauce and stir to coat. Let marinate for at least 15 minutes to saturate the tofu and infuse the flavor.
 1. In the meantime, shred your cauliflower into rice by using a large grater or food processor. You don’t want it too fine, just somewhat close to the texture of rice. Set aside. Mince garlic if you haven’t already done so, and prepare any veggies you want to add to the dish (optional).
 1. Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat (6 out of 10), and if adding any veggies to your dish, cook them now in a bit of sesame oil and a dash of soy sauce. Remove from pan and set aside and cover to keep warm.
 1. Use a slotted spoon to spoon tofu into the preheated pan. Add a few spoonfuls of the sauce to coat. Cook, stirring frequently for a few minutes until browned. It will stick to the pan a bit, so don't worry. Remove from pan and set aside and cover to keep warm.
 1. Rinse your pan under very hot water water and scrape away any residue. Place back on oven.
 1. Add a drizzle of sesame oil to the pan, then add garlic and cauliflower rice and stir. Put cover on to steam the “rice.” Cook for about 5-8 minutes until slightly browned and tender, stirring occasionally. Then add a few spoonfuls of sauce to season and stir.
 1. Place cauliflower rice and top with veggies and tofu. Serve with any leftover sauce. Leftovers reheat well and will keep covered in the fridge for up to a couple days.
