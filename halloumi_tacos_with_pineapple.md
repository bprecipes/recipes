Halloumi Tacos with Pineapple Salsa & Aji Verde
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 8 small corn or flour tortillas
 * 8 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced into ¼” wide rounds
 * ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, for frying

Pineapple Salsa
-----------
 * 3 cups diced fresh pineapple (about 1 medium)
 * 1 red bell pepper, chopped
 * 1/2 cup chopped red onion (about ½ small onion)
 * 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
 * 1 medium jalapeño*, seeds and ribs removed, finely chopped
 * 3 tablespoons lime juice (from about 1 ½ limes), or more if needed
 * 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

Aji Verde (you’ll have extra)
-----------
 * 1/2 cup mayonnaise
 * 2 cups lightly packed fresh cilantro, mostly leaves but small stems are ok (from 1 big bunch of cilantro or 1 ½ medium)
 * 2 medium jalapeños, seeds and membranes removed but reserved, roughly chopped
 * 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
 * 1/3 cup (1 ounce) grated Cotija or Parmesan cheese
 * 1 tablespoon lime juice
 * 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

Directions
---------
 0. Make the Aji Verde: In a food processor or blender, combine all of the ingredients. Blend until the cilantro has broken into very tiny pieces and the sauce is green and mostly smooth (no matter how long you blend it, it will still have some texture to it).A
 0. Make the pineapple salsa
 0. Warm tortillas
 0. Warm the olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Using kitchen tongs, carefully place slices of halloumi into the hot oil (be careful, the oil can splatter). Leave a little room around each piece of cheese so they don’t stick together (I usually cook the cheese in two batches). I recommend covering the skillet to contain any splatters.
 0. Cook the cheese until the undersides are golden, about 2 to 4 minutes (if it’s taking forever to brown, raise the heat a bit; if it’s browning very quickly or you catch any whiff of smoke, turn down the heat). Carefully flip each piece of cheese with the tongs, recover the skillet, and cook until the other side is golden, about 2 to 4 minutes.
 0. In the meantime, place a few paper towels on an empty plate or cutting board to absorb excess oil. Place each piece of cooked cheese onto the plate and let the cheese cool down a bit before handling. Slice each piece of cheese into strips about 1″ wide for more even cheese distribution throughout your taco (hooray).
 0. To assemble the tacos, place a few strips of cheese along half of your tortilla. Using a slotted spoon or serving fork, top the cheese with pineapple salsa. Finish each taco with a drizzle of aji verde. Serve warm!
 0. If you intend to have leftovers, store the individual components separately and combine just before serving. You can gently warm the tortillas and cheese in the microwave. Assemble and enjoy.
