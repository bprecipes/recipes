Coconut Curry Noodle Bowls
=========

Coconut Curry Sauce
-----------
 * 1 tablespoon oil
 * 2 shallots
 * 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced (or a paste – I like this stuff)
 * 2 tablespoons red curry paste
 * 1 14–ounce can regular coconut milk
 * 1/2 cup reduced sodium chicken or veggie broth (optional – see notes)
 * 3 tablespoons sugar
 * 1 tablespoon hot chili paste (sambal oelek)
 * 2 tablespoons fish sauce
 * 2 tablespoons soy sauce

Bowls
-----------
 * 4 ounces rice noodles
 * 1 tablespoon oil
 * half an onion, chopped
 * 1 cup chopped broccoli florets
 * 1 cup shredded carrots
 * 1 cup chopped asparagus
 * 1 cup shredded purple cabbage
 * sesame seeds for topping
 * limes for serving
 * a handful of fresh basil for serving

Directions
---------
 1. Noodles: Soak the noodles in a bowl of cold water. Start this right away – they need at least 20 minutes or so of soaking. When they’re soft, drain and rinse.
 2. Sauce: Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the shallots and ginger; stir fry for 3-5 minutes. Add the curry paste; stir fry for 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, sugar, chili paste, fish sauce, and soy sauce. Simmer for 15 minutes or so while you prep the rest of the ingredients – it should thicken slightly. If you’re adding the broth to make the sauce go farther, you might need a little extra simmer time for the sauce to thicken.
 3. Vegetables and Assembly: In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat. Add the onion, carrots, broccoli, and asparagus. Stir fry for about 5 minutes until the broccoli and asparagus are bright green. Add the noodles and toss around in the pan with the vegetables. Add the sauce and toss together until just combined (if you cook it too long at this point, the noodles might get too sticky). Serve topped with the purple cabbage and sesame seeds and a squeeze of lime or basil leaves if you want.
