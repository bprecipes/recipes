 * wide strips of lime zest from 1 lime

Crispy tofu
-----------
 * 14 ounce block firm or extra firm tofu, pressed for 30 minutes
 * 2 teaspoons avocado oil
 * 1 tablespoon arrowroot starch
 * sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste
 * any other seasoning you like (garlic powder, chili powder, nutritional yeast, Old Bay even!)

Bowl
-----------
 * 2 cups cooked quinoa, or other grain that you like
 * cooked or raw vegetables to accompany (I like roasted broccoli)
 * sliced green onions
 * chopped cilantro
 * lime wedges
 * sesame seeds

Directions
---------
 0. Make the golden coconut broth. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add the avocado oil and swish it around. Transfer the shallots to the pot and stir. Keep sauteing and stirring the shallots until they are slightly browned and soft. Then, add the ginger, garlic, chili, and the lime zest. Stir and saute until fragrant and garlic/ginger is slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add the turmeric to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Stir the vegetables.
 0. Add the water and the coconut milk to the pot and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then lower to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered for 15 minutes. Set a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl.
 0. After 15 minutes, run the mixture through the fine strainer. Return the broth to the large pot. Add the tamari to the broth and stir. Place the miso in a small bowl and ladle a bit of the broth on top. Dissolve the miso in the broth with a spoon and pour it into the large pot of golden coconut broth. Taste the broth at this point and adjust the seasoning (more salt, pepper, tamari, acidity, spice, etc). Keep broth warm.
 0. Make the crispy tofu. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dry the tofu and cut it into ¾ – 1-inch cubes. Place the tofu in a large bowl. Toss the bowl with the oil to coat. Sprinkle in the arrowroot, salt, pepper, and seasoning of choice. Quickly toss the tofu to coat again. Arrange the tofu on the baking sheet. Slide the tofu into the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
 0. At the 15 minute mark, take the tofu out and flip over all the pieces. Return the tofu to the oven and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until golden and crispy on all sides.
 0. Make the golden coconut broth bowls. Heap up a serving of quinoa in a serving bowl (preferably a wide and shallow bowl). Pour one cup of the broth into the bowl. Place a handful (about a quarter of the batch) of the crispy tofu into the bowl. Top the golden coconut broth bowls with any other vegetables you’re including, green onions, cilantro, squeezes of lime, and sesame seeds.
