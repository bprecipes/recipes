Caramelized Zucchini Frittata
=========

Filling
-----------
 * 1/2 medium onion, minced (174g/6oz)
 * 1 medium zucchini, 1/4" cubed (3/4lb/340g)
 * 2 tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil
 * 1/4 teaspoon sea salt

Frittata
-----------
 * 6 large Pete and Gerry Organic Eggs
 * 1/2 cup whole milk
 * 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
 * 2 ounces shredded cheddar cheese
 * Black pepper, for topping
 * Julienned Basil, for topping

Directions
---------
 0. Heat oven to 425˚F. 
 1. Heat an 8” oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the butter or olive oil followed by the onions, zucchini, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 15-20 minutes until the zucchini and onions are tender, browning, and cooked down.
 2. Whisk together eggs, milk, and salt. When the zucchini has cooked down, reduce the heat to low and pour in the egg mixture. Swirl the eggs around the pan and loosen any filling on the bottom with a spatula. Cook for a few minutes to let the bottom of the frittata set. 
 3. Sprinkle the cheese on top and transfer to the oven. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until the eggs are fully set, and the top of the frittata is puffed up and golden. 

Sprinkle with black pepper and basil before serving.
