 * 2 1/2 tbsp olive oil, divided into 1 tbsp & 1 1/2 tbsp
 * 3/4 cup sunflower or canola oil

Directions
---------
 0. Start by putting the wild rice in a small saucepan, cover with plenty of water, bring to a boil, and leave to simmer for about 40 minutes, until the rice is cooked but still quite firm. Drain and set aside.
 1. To cook the basmati rice, pour 1 tablespoon of the olive oil into a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and place over high heat. Add the rice and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and stir as you warm up the rice (about 2-3 minutes). Carefully add the water, and decrease the heat to very low, cover the pan with the lid, and leave to cook for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove the pan from the heat, keep the lid on and leave off the heat for 10 minutes.
 2. While the rice is cooking, prepare the chickpeas. Heat the remaining 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil in a large wok or saute pan over high heat. Add the cumin seeds and curry powder, wait for a couple seconds, and then add the chickpeas and 1/4 teaspoon salt; make sure you do this quickly or the spices may burn in the oil. Stir over the heat for a minute or two, just to heat the chickpeas and set the pan aside.
