Golden French Lentil Stew
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 1/2 cup raw cashews, or ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons raw sunflower seeds
 * 2 cups water
 * 2 tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
 * 1 large yellow or sweet onion, diced, or 2 leeks, cleaned and thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
 * 4 large cloves garlic, minced (2 tablespoons)
 * 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt, to taste, plus a couple pinches
 * 2 medium carrots, diced (1 heaping cup)
 * 2 stalks celery, diced (3/4 cup)
 * 2 teaspoons ground cumin
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
 * 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
 * 1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can of diced tomatoes, with juices
 * 3/4 cup  uncooked French green lentils, picked over and rinsed
 * 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
 * 3 cups stemmed and chopped Swiss chard or kale leaves
 * Freshly ground black pepper
 * 1 to 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar, to taste

Directions
---------
1. Begin by placing the cashews or sunflower seeds in a bowl and cover with a couple of inches of water. Soak for 1 to 2 hours or overnight (or quick soaked for 1hr with boiling water). Once the seeds have soften, drain and rinse them and add to a high-speed blender along with ½ cup of the water. Blend on high until super smooth and creamy. Set the nut cream aside.
2. In a large Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and a couple pinches of salt, and sauté until the onion is softened, 4 to 6 minutes.
3. Stir in the chopped carrots and celery, and cook for another few minutes or so. Stir in the cumin, thyme, and turmeric.
4. Add the diced tomatoes with their juices, along with the lentils, broth, and remaining water. Turn up the heat to high and bring the mixture to a low boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, for 30 to 35 minutes, until the lentils have softened.
5. Once the lentils have cooked, stir in the nut cream and chard. Season with salt, pepper, and vinegar to taste. Cook for a couple of minutes over low-medium heat, until the chard is wilted. Serve alongside some crusty bread.
