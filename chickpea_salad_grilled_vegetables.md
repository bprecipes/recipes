Chickpea salad with grilled vegetables
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 1 large eggplant
 * olive oil
 * 1 can / scant cups cooked chickpeas
 * 25 cherry tomatoes, halved
 * 1 spring onion / scallion, finely sliced

Zhough dressing
-----------
 * 0.7 oz cilantro
 * 0.35 oz flat leaf parsley
 * 1 garlic clove
 * 1/8 tsp ground cardamom
 * 1/4 tsp ground cumin
 * 1/4 tsp ground coriander
 * a pinch of chilli flakes
 * 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
 * 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice + zest of 1 small lemon
 * salt and pepper, to taste

Directions
---------
 0. Pre-heat grill and slice eggplant / aubergine into 1.25 cm / 0.5″ thick slices. Brush them with olive oil.
 0. Arrange sliced aubergine on the preheated gridle pan and leave undisturbed until deep char marks develop (about 5-6 minutes) – the slices in the middle of the pan are likely to be done quicker so start checking on them first.
 0. Once done on one side, flip aubergine slices and grill until tender and charred on both sides. Transfer to a plate, season lightly and set aside.
 0. Brush the skin of the tomato halves with oil and arrange them on the gridle pan cut side up. Grill until charred, then brush the cut sides with more oil and flip so that the cut side is touching the pan. Continue to grill for only a little longer, until softened and gently charred. Take off the pan and season lightly.
 0. Coat drained chickpeas in a couple of tablespoons or so of the dressing. Arrange dressed chickpeas on a platter with charred aubergines and tomatoes and sliced spring onion, drizzle with more dressing (you are likely to have leftovers).
 0. Sprinkle with fresh coriander.
