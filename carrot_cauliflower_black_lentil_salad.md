Carrot, Cauliflower + Black Lentil Salad
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 4 large carrots (approx. 500g) ends trimmed and sliced into bite-sized chunks
 * 1/2 large cauliflower cut into florets (cut stem into chunks and use too)
 * 2-3 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1/4 cup beluga (black) lentils  (or use French-style lentils)
 * 1/2 red onion finely sliced
 * large handful flat-leaf parsley roughly chopped

Honey Mustard Dressing
-----------
 * 1 tablespoon honey (use sugar or brown rice syrup for vegan alternative)
 * 1 tablespoon wholegrain mustard
 * 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
 * 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

Directions
---------
 0. Preheat oven to 200C (400F). Place chopped carrots and cauliflower onto separate oven trays, drizzle both with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast 25–30 minutes or until tender and golden (the carrots will likely take a few more minutes than the cauliflower), stirring occasionally and rotating trays halfway to ensure even cooking.
 0. Meanwhile, place lentils into a small saucepan, cover with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook 10–12 minutes or until tender but not mushy. Drain well.
 0. In a small bowl combine honey and mustard and mix well. Whisk in apple cider vinegar, then continue to whisk as you drizzle in the olive oil to emulsify. Season with salt and pepper.
 0. Place red onion into a large serving bowl, add a few tablespoons of dressing and mix well, setting aside to marinate while the vegetables and lentils are cooking.
 0. To serve, add cooked vegetables and drained lentils to the serving bowl, drizzle with enough dressing to coat (any leftovers will store in a glass jar in the fridge for up to 1 week), scatter over chopped parsley and mix well.
