Ingredients
-----------
* 8 ounces dried rice noodles

Pad Thai Sauce
-----------
 * 3 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to attain sweet-sour balance
 * 1/4 cup vegetable stock, or faux chicken stock
 * 3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, or wheat-free soy sauce
 * 2 1/4 teaspoons tamarind paste, or to taste
 * 1/2 to 1 teaspoon chili sauce, or to taste, or 1/8 to 3/4 teaspoon chile flakes

For the Stir-Fry
-----------
 * 3 to 4 tablespoons peanut or coconut oil
 * 4 cloves garlic, minced
 * 3 tablespoons diced onion
 * 3 to 4 heads baby bok choy or 1 regular bok choy, cut into large dice
 * 2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable stock or white wine
 * 1 to 2 large eggs or 1/2 cup soft tofu
 * 2 to 3 cups bean sprouts
 * 2 green onions, sliced
 * 1/4 cup chopped unsalted dry-roasted peanuts or cashews, divided
 * 1/3 cup fresh cilantro, for garnish
 * 2 wedges lime, plus more to taste and for garnish

Directions
---------

1. Cook noodles only 4-6 minutes, drain, rince with cold water
2. Combine the pad thai sauce ingredients in a cup, stirring well to dissolve sugar and tamarind.
3. Warm a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the oil plus garlic and onion. Stir-fry for 1 minute to release the fragrance. 
4. Add bok choy plus enough stock or white wine to keep ingredients frying nicely. Stir-fry 2 minutes, or until bok choy is bright green and slightly softened. 
5. Push the ingredients aside and add 1/2 tablespoon more of the oil to the center of the wok/pan. Add the egg (if usingâ€”don't add the alternative soft tofu quite yet) and stir-fry briefly to scramble. 
6. If the pan is dry, push the ingredients aside and add a little more of the oil to the middle. Add the drained noodles and 1/3 of the pad thai sauce. Stir-fry everything together for 1 to 2 minutes using 2 utensils 
7. Continue adding sauce and stir-frying for 3 to 6 more minutes, or until all sauce is added and noodles are soft but still chewy and deliciously sticky. 
8. Switch off the heat and add bean sprouts, green onions, and 3/4 of the nuts. Toss and taste/adjust.
