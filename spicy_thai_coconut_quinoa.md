Spicy thai coconut quinoa
=========

For the dressing
--------
 * 1 2/3 cups fresh cilantro (from about 1/2 bunch), long, thick stems removed
 * 3/4 cup roasted, unsalted peanuts
 * 1/3 cup Sriracha hot sauce
 * 2 tablespoons finely grated lime zest (from about 3 medium limes)
 * 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from about 3 medium limes)
 * 1/4 cup toasted sesame oil
 * 1 tablespoon packed dark brown sugar
 * 2 medium garlic cloves
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

For the quinoa:
--------
 * 2 cups quinoa, any color or variety
 * 1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
 * 1 1/3 cups vegetable stock or low-sodium vegetable broth
 * 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
 * 1 (14- to 16-ounce) package firm tofu
 * 2 medium carrots (about 8 ounces)
 * 1 medium broccoli head (about 1 pound)
 * 4 medium scallions
 * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

To garnish:
--------
 * Coarsely chopped fresh cilantro
 * Coarsely chopped roasted, unsalted peanuts
 * Thinly sliced scallions

Directions
--------
 1. Place all of the dressing ingredients in a food processor fitted with a blade attachment. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 1 minute; set aside.
 2. Place quinoa in a large saucepan; add the coconut milk, vegetable broth, and measured salt; and stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked.
 3. Meanwhile, line a large plate with several layers of paper towels. Drain the tofu, cut it into large dice, and place it in a single layer on the paper-towel-lined plate; set aside. 
 4. Trim the carrots and cut them into 1/8-inch-thick rounds; set aside. 
 5. Trim the stem of the broccoli to 1/2 inch and cut the head into 1-inch florets; set aside. 
 6. Thinly slice the white and light green parts of the scallions; set aside.
 7. When the quinoa is ready, remove it to a large serving bowl and set aside. Wash the saucepan, fill it with water, and season generously with salt. Cover with a tightfitting lid and bring to a boil over high heat.
 8. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the tofu and cook without stirring until the bottoms are golden brown, about 4 minutes. (While the tofu is cooking, line the plate you drained it on with fresh paper towels.) Flip and cook until the other sides are golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes more. Using a slotted spoon, remove to the paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt; set aside.
 9. Add the carrots to the boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove them to the bowl with the quinoa. Return the water to a boil, add the broccoli, and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and place in the bowl with the quinoa and carrots.
 10. Add the cooked tofu, dressing, and scallions to the bowl and stir to combine. Garnish with additional cilantro, peanuts, and scallions before serving.

Notes:
 * I cut back a bit on the sesame oil
