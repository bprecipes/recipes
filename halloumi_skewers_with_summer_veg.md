Marinated Halloumi Skewers with Summer Veg and Chipotle-Lime Peanut Sauce
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 8 ounces halloumi
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 garlic clove, minced
 * 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Skewers
-----------
 * 1 bell peppers
 * 1 medium zucchini
 * 1/2 red onion
 * 2 cups cherry tomatoes

Peanut Butter Sauce
-----------
 * 1/3 cup peanut butter (see note)
 * 1/4 to 1/3 cup water
 * 2 tablespoons lime juice
 * 1 tablespoon honey or cane sugar
 * 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
 * 1 tablespoon minced chipotle in adobo
 * 1/2 teaspoon salt 

Directions
---------
 0. An hour before you’re ready to start grilling, drain and rinse the halloumi. Pat dry, cut into 1/2” to 1” cubes, and toss with the olive oil, minced garlic, and black pepper. Let rest for an hour. At this time, if you’re using wooden skewers, stick in water to soak as well.
 0. Prep the vegetables for the skewers. Cut pepper, zucchini, and onions into roughly the same width as the halloumi. Leave the tomatoes whole.
 0. Also while you’re waiting for the halloumi to marinate, make the peanut butter sauce. Combine the ingredients for the sauce and stir until well combined. Start with ¼ cup of the water and add more as needed to reach a sauce that is thin enough to drizzle. Taste and adjust salt as needed.
 0. When ready to assemble the skewers, thread the vegetables and halloumi on each skewer, using around 2 to 3 pieces of halloumi. If you notice your halloumi breaking, try and thread through the break (sometimes this is unavoidable but most of the time I can get the halloumi to stay on the skewer).
 0. Preheat grill or a grill pan to medium-high heat, you can also broil.
 0. Place skewers on clean grill grate and cook, rotating occasionally, until cheese and vegetables are charred. Remove from heat and let slightly cool.
