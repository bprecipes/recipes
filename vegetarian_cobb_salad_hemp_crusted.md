 * 1 lb whole green beans, blanched
 * 2 C tomato wedges or halved cherry tomatoes
 * 2 C frozen corn, thawed and drained of excess water
 * 2 avocados, diced or cut into wedges
 * 1 C ranch dressing

Hemp crusted tofu
-----------
 * 1 x 350 g or 400 g brick of firm tofu
 * 1/2 C gluten-free bread crumbs
 * 1/2 C hemp hearts
 * 2 tsp chili powder
 * 2 tsp garlic powder
 * 1 tsp sea salt
 * 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
 * 2 tbsp dijon mustard
 * 1 tbsp nondairy milk

Ranch Dressing
-----------
 * 1 C mayonnaise
 * 1/8 C nondairy milk
 * 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
 * 1 tsp onion powder
 * 1/4 tsp sea salt
 * 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
 * 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh dill
 * 1 tbsp finely chopped parsley
 * 1 tbsp finely chopped chives

Directions
---------
 1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F.
 2. Drain the brick of tofu from the packaging water and pat dry with a tea towel or paper towel.
 3. Cut into 8 thick sticks or depending on the shape of your tofu brick you can cut those in half again for 16 pieces. They should be like a fish stick style shape.
 4. In a mixing bowl combine the bread crumbs, hemp hearts, spices, sea salt, and ground pepper. In another smaller bowl combine dijon with nondairy milk until smooth and well combined.
 5. Brush the dijon mixture evenly on each tofu stick coating well. Then coat fully in the bread crumb mixture. Place sticks on a parchment lined baking sheet.
 6. Spray the sticks with a light coating of vegetable oil and bake for 30 minutes flipping over half way through the bake time. They should be a deep golden brown.
 7. Mix dressing
 8. To make blanched green beans that are still bright green and crunchy you can boil them or steam them in a pot and then just as they turn bright green all over and are tender, drain them from the hot water and submerge them into a large bowl of ice water. Then once they've been submerged for 5 to 10 minutes you can drain them from the water into a colander. Serve them immediately on the salad or pat dry and store for 2 days in a container in the fridge.
 9. Assemble the salads with romaine lettuce, a handful of corn, green beans, a few tomato wedges, and cubed avocado. Top with 3 to 4 tofu nuggets per salad and drizzle with ranch dressing!
