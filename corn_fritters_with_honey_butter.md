Corn Fritters with Whipped Hot Honey Butter
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 3 3/4 cup corn
 * 1/4 cup chopped basil
 * 1 Tbsp chopped scallions
 * 2/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese
 * 3/4 tsp salt
 * 1/2 freshly ground black pepper
 * 3 lightly beaten large eggs
 * 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
 * olive oil for frying

For the Whipped Hot Honey Butter:
-----------
 * 8 Tbsp unsalted butter (1 stick) room temperature
 * 3 Tbsp honey
 * 1 Tbsp hot sauce (+ more if you like things spicy)



Directions
---------
 0. Whisk together the corn kernels, basil, scallions, cheese, salt, pepper, and eggs. Fold in the flour just until everything is combined.
 1. Heat enough olive oil in a medium pan to cover the bottom over medium heat. Line a dinner plate with parchment paper and set aside. Add 2 heaping tablespoons batter into the warmed oil and press gently to flatten into a fritter. Depending on the size of your pan, you should be able to fit 2-4 fritters into the pan (make sure not to overcrowd â€“ none of the fritters should be touching). Cook until the fritters are golden brown on the bottoms, 1-3 minutes (time will vary depending on how hot your oil gets so check often) and then flip. Cook for an additional 1-3 minutes or until golden on the second side and transfer to the paper towel lined plate. Repeat with the rest of the batter.
 2. Meanwhile, while the fritters are cooking, use a stand mixer or handheld mixer to whip the butter until light and fluffy. With the mixer on medium, slowly stream in the honey and hot sauce and whip until combined. Transfer to a small serving bowl and set aside.

Serve the fritters warm with dollops of the whipped hot honey butter and a sprinkle of salt.
