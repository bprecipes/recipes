Ingredients

    * 1 cup finely chopped onion
    * 1 garlic clove, minced
    * 1 teaspoon canola oil
    * 1 cup dried lentils, rinsed
    * 1 tablespoon chili powder
    * 2 teaspoons ground cumin
    * 1 teaspoon dried oregano
    * 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
    * 1 cup salsa
    * 12 taco shells
    * 1 1/2 cups shredded lettuce
    * 1 cup chopped fresh tomato
    * 1 1/2 cups shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
    * 6 tablespoons fat free sour cream

Directions

   1. In a large nonstick skillet, saute the onion and garlic in oil until tender. Add the lentils, chili powder, cumin and oregano; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes or until the lentils are tender. Uncover; cook for 6-8 minutes or until mixture is thickened. Mash lentils slightly.
   2. Stir in salsa. Spoon about 1/4 cup lentil mixture into each taco shell. Top with lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream.


Notes
 Very good, tastes like greesy beef tacos
 Avocado instead of lettuce if you want
