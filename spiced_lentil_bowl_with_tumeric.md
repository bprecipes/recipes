Spiced lentil bowls with turmeric seeds
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 2 cups cooked lentils (I used puy-style)
 * 1 tablespoon olive oil or ghee
 * 1/2 red onion, finely diced
 * 1 clove garlic, crushed
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
 * 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
 * 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
 * The juice of 1 small lemon
 * Handful coriander (cilantro) leaves, roughly chopped
 * Salad greens, sautéed asparagus spears, sprouts + yoghurt (dairy or coconut), turmeric seeds (below), to serve

Turmeric seeds
-----------
 * 65 g ( 1/2 cup) sunflower seeds
 * 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
 * 1 teaspoon olive oil
 * 1/2 teaspoon gluten-free soy sauce
 * 3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric

Directions
---------
 1. Drain lentils well. Heat a large frying pan (skillet) over medium high heat, add olive oil or ghee and cook onion 3-4 minutes or until tender and golden. Add garlic and spices and cook for a further 30 seconds. Add drained lentils, stirring to heat through. Remove from the heat, add lemon juice, coriander (cilantro) and season with fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
 2. To make the turmeric seeds, toast sunflower and sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over medium-high heat, stirring often until light golden in places. Add olive oil and soy sauce and stir to evenly coat. Continue to cook for a further 30-60 seconds, while stirring, until seeds are dry and deep golden. Add turmeric, stir well and cook 10 seconds more before removing from the heat and setting aside to cool. Any leftover seeds will store in an airtight jar for up to a week.
 3. To serve, divide lentils between two bowls, add some sautéed asparagus, a handful of salad greens, sprouts and a dollop of yoghurt (dairy or coconut). Scatter with turmeric seeds and serve immediately.
