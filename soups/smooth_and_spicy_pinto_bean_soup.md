Smooth and Spicy Pinto Bean Soup
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 * 1 large yellow onion, sliced
 * 4 garlic cloves, sliced
 * 1 teaspoon ground cumin
 * 1 teaspoon ground fennel seeds
 * 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
 * 4 ancho, guajillo, or New Mexico chiles, stemmed, seeds removed
 * 1 14.5-ounce can pinto beans, drained
 * Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
 * Shredded cooked chicken or hominy (optional), corn chips, sliced avocado (optional), and plain yogurt (for serving)
 * 4 red radishes, very thinly sliced
 * 1/2 small white onion, very thinly sliced
 * Crumbled cotija cheese (for serving)

Directions
---------
 1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Cook yellow onion, stirring often, until very tender and just beginning to brown, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until very fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add cumin and fennel and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth and chiles and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook, maintaining a gentle simmer, until chiles are rehydrated and very soft, 25–35 minutes.
 2. Pour soup into a blender (reserving saucepan) and add beans. Carefully purée until smooth. Return soup to saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in chicken, if using.
 3. Place corn chips in serving bowls and top with stew. Lay avocado on top, if using. Add a dollop yogurt, then top with radishes and white onion. Sprinkle with cotija.
