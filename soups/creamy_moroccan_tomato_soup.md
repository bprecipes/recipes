Creamy Moroccan Tomato Soup
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
 * 1 small yellow onion, chopped
 * 3 cloves garlic, smashed
 * kosher salt and black pepper
 * 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
 * 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
 * 2 (28 ounce) cans diced fire roasted tomatoes
 * 2-3 tablespoons harissa sauce
 * 2 teaspoons honey, or real maple syrup
 * 1 can (14 ounce) full fat coconut milk
 * 1/4 cup fresh cilantro or basil, chopped
 * 4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled (optional)
 * crispy chickpeas, for serving (optional)

Directions
---------
 1. Heat the olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onion and garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook 5 minutes or until the onion is fragrant and beginning to caramelize. Add the thyme, paprika, and cumin, cook another minute. Stir in the tomatoes, harissa, and honey. Cook 5 minutes until bubbling. 
 2. Pour in the coconut milk. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree until mostly smooth. Return the soup to the pot and place over medium heat, Stir in the cilantro and half of the goat cheese, if using, and season the soup with salt and pepper. Thin with more coconut milk, if desired. Cook until warmed though, 5-10 minutes. 
 3. To serve, ladle the soup among bowls and top with goat cheese, cilantro, and chickpeas. I recommend serving with a grilled cheese on the side!
