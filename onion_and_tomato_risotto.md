Caramelized Onion & Tomato Risotto
============

Ingredients
-----------
 * 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, divided
 * 1 pound yellow onions thinly sliced
 * 1 teaspoon organic granulated sugar
 * 1/2 pounds on the vine tomatoes halved (decreased from original 2)
 * 3 garlic cloves, minced
 * 1 cup dry white wine
 * 1 tablespoons tomato paste
 * 1 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves (or 2 teaspoons dried)
 * 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
 * 3-4 cups vegetable broth, warmed
 * 1/2 cup full-fat coconut milk
 * salt to taste
 * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste

Directions
-----------
 1. Coat the bottom of a large pot with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place over medium-low heat. 
 1. Add the onion and toss a few times to coat the onions with oil.
 1. After 20 or 30 minutes the onions should begin to soften up and darken (if not, turn up the heat just a smidge). Stir in the sugar at this point.
 1. Continue to cook until the onions are very soft and brown, about 30 minutes more, stirring occasionally.
 1. While the onions caramelize, prepare the tomatoes (unless using canned). Preheat the oven to 400Â°.
 1. Rub the tomato halves with 1 teaspoon of olive oil and arrange them in an oven safe skillet or roasting pan.
 1. Roast the tomatoes until the skins become wrinkly and blistered, about 25 minutes.
 1. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and allow them to cool for a bit.
 1. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the seeds and peels, then coarsely chop the tomatoes. Retain any juices that form in the pan while they roast.
 1. When the onions are caramelized, turn the heat up to medium and add the garlic. SautÃ© for about 1 minute, until very fragrant.
 1. Stir in the wine, tomatoes, tomato paste and thyme. Raise the heat and bring the liquid to a boil.
 1. Lower the heat and allow the mixture to cook for about 5 minutes, until the liquid reduces by about a third.
 1. Stir the rice into the pot. Allow the mixture to simmer, stirring frequently, until most of the remaining liquid has been absorbed by the rice.
 1. Begin adding the broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, and allowing the mixture to simmer until most of the liquid as been absorbed before making the next addition. Stir the mixture frequently during this process and continue until you've added between 3 and 4 cups of broth and the rice is tender, for about 20 minutes.
 1. Stir in the coconut milk and allow the mixture to simmer for 2 or 3 minutes more, until the sauce is thick and creamy.
 1. Remove the pot from heat and season with salt and pepper.

Notes:
 * Tomatos were decreased from original
