Ingredients
-----------
 * 2 small sweet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch rounds
 * 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
 * 1 tablespoon honey
 * crushed red pepper flakes
 * kosher salt
 * 1 bunch Tuscan kale spinach or bok choy, chopped

 * 8 ounces rice noodles

 * 1/2 cup tahini
 * 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce or tamari
 * 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
 * 2 tablespoons honey
 * 1 tablespoon chili paste (I use sambal oelek)
 * 2 inches fresh ginger, grated
 * 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated
 * juice from 1 lime
 * 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
 * 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
 * sliced cucumbers and toasted sesame seeds, for serving

Directions
---------
 0. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. 
 1. On a rimmed baking sheet, combine the sweet potatoes, 2 tablespoons olive oil, honey, crushed red pepper flakes, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Arrange in an even layer. Transfer to the oven and roast for 25-30 minutes, tossing halfway through cooking, until the potatoes are caramelized. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, add the greens to the sheet pan and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook until wilted.
 2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to package directions.
 3. Combine in a food processor the tahini, soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, chili paste, ginger, garlic, and 1/4 cup water. Pulse until combined and smooth, adding additional water as needed to thin the sauce. Pour the sauce over the hot noodles. Add the lime juice, basil, and cilantro, tossing to combine.
 4. Divide the noodles between bowls. Top with sweet potatoes and greens. Sprinkle on sesame seeds and finish with cucumbers. Enjoy warm or at room temp.
