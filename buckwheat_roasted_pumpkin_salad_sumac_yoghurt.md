Directions
---------
 0. To cook Buckwheat, bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil, add buckwheat and cook 10-12 minutes or until tender (it will still have some bite). Drain well and set aside to cool.
 0. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200C (400F). Peel and de-seed pumpkin (squash), then slice into small wedges. Transfer to an oven tray, drizzle with half the olive oil, season and roast for 30-40 minutes or until tender and golden.
 0. While the pumpkin is roasting, prepare the pickled red onion. Place the sliced red onion in a shallow bowl and roughly break up into single strands using your hands. Combine apple cider vinegar, sugar, and sea salt in a small saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring often to dissolve the sugar. Once boiling, remove from the heat and immediately pour over the onion. Set aside to cool, stirring occasionally.
 0. To make the sumac yoghurt, place all ingredients in a bowl and mix well.
 0. To assemble salad, place cooked buckwheat, pumpkin, the remaining olive oil, lemon juice and herbs in a bowl and mix well. Divide between bowl, top with drained pickled onion and dollop with sumac yoghurt.
