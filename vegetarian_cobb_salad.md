Vegetarian Cobb Salad with Grilled Tofu & Coconut Bacon
=========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 4 large eggs
 * 1 head romaine lettuce, washed and torn into bite-sized pieces or coarsely chopped
 * 1 cup cherry tomatoes, stemmed and halved
 * 2 large California avocados, firm-ripe, peeled, pitted, and sliced
 * 2 ounces blue cheese or goat cheese, crumbled
 * 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives
 * Flaky salt and coarsely ground black pepper

Dressing
-----------
 * 2 tablespoons diced shallot
 * 1/4 cup (60 ml) red-wine vinegar
 * 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
 * 1/2 teaspoon fine sea or kosher salt
 * 1/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
 * 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons (90 ml) mild extra-virgin olive oil (or a blend of olive oil and sunflower oil)

Tofu
-----------
 * 10-12 ounces firm or extra firm tofu, cut into half-inch thick slices (I prefer Hodo brand organic tofu)
 * 2 tablespoons (30 ml) tamari
 * 2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil or neutral cooking oil such as sunflower oil
 * 2 tablespoons (30 ml) maple syrup
 * Zest and juice of 1 large lemon
 * 2 large garlic cloves, pressed or minced
 * 1 teaspoon fine sea or kosher salt
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
 * 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
 * Oil for the grill

Coconut Bacon
-----------
 * 1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
 * 1 tablespoons gluten-free tamari (or try coconut aminos for paleo-friendly)
 * 2 teaspoons maple syrup
 * 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke

Directions
---------
 1. Drain and then marinate tofu. Cook without majority of marinade in nonstick pan, add extra marinade when almost done.
 2. Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 300ÂºF. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
 3. In a large bowl, toss together the coconut flakes, tamari, maple syrup, and liquid smoke until the coconut is evenly coated.
 4. Spread the coconut bacon on the baking sheet in an even layer and place in the oven. Bake until deep golden brown, 14-20 minutes, tossing the bacon gently once or twice during the baking process. This helps it cook evenly and keeps it from sticking, but take care not to crush up the coconut as you toss.
 5. The coconut bacon will be soft at first but will firm up when cool.
 6. Make the dressing
 7. Place the eggs in a small saucepan, cover with 1 inch of water, and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Remove the pot from the heat, cover, and let sit 7 minutes. Drain the eggs, fill the pot with ice and cool water, and let sit 10 minutes. Peel the eggs and cut into halves or slices.
 8. Toss the lettuce with some of the dressing to coat, then arrange on a platter or serving bowl.
 9. Top with the coconut bacon, eggs, tomatoes, avocados, and grilled tofu.
 10. Sprinkle the cheese and chives over the salad, drizzle with more dressing, flaky salt, and pepper, and serve.
