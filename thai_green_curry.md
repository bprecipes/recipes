Thai green curry
=========

Paste
-----------
 * 2 medium shallots
 * 4 garlic cloves
 * thumb-size piece of ginger
 * 2 stalks of lemongrass, soft inner part chopped roughly
 * 4 green Thai chillies (deseeded for less heat)
 * 1 tsp ground coriander
 * 1/2 tsp ground cumin
 * 1/4 tsp ground white (or black if unavailable) pepper
 * coriander stalks from a big bunch of coriander (use the leaves to serve)
 * 1 tsp salt

Curry sauce
-----------
 * 3 tbsp / 45 ml neutral tasting oil
 * 400 ml / 14 oz full fat coconut milk
 * 6 fresh Kaffir lime leaves, or zest of lime
 * 1 1/2 - 2 cups veggie stock
 * 2 tsp tamari
 * 1 tsp fish sauce
 * juice of half a lime
 * approx. 2 tsp sugar (I used coconut sugar), adjust to taste

Filling
-----------
 * 1/2 small butternut squash or a sweet potato, cubed
 * a small eggplant, cubed
 * 50 g / 1.5 oz sugar snap peas, sliced on the diagonal
 * 100 g / 3.5 oz tenderstem broccoli
 * a handful of bean sprouts, blanched

Rice for serving

Directions
---------
 0. In a food processor, combine all the paste ingredients until finely chopped.
 1. Heat up oil in a heavy-bottomed casserole dish on a low heat. Add curry paste to the hot oil and fry it off gently, for 10 minutes, stirring the entire time.
 2. Stir in coconut milk.
 3. Finally add in the lime leaves and stock (or water). Start off with 1 cup of stock and add more to achieve the desired consistency.
 4. Allow the sauce to come to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 10-15 minutes on a low heat.
 5. Season with tamari and fish sauce, lime juice and a touch of sugar (if needed).
 6. In terms of the veggies, you could simply cook them in the simmering curry, but that gives you less control over the ‘doneness’ of the individual elements and it affects the colour of the green veggies. I personally prefer to bake the butternut squash and aubergine in the oven and to steam the sugar snap peas and broccoli. I baked the butternut squash and aubergine in a 400F oven for about 20 minutes (turning them once, after 10 minutes) after coating them in a bit of olive oil. I steamed my sugar snap peas for 2 minutes and tenderstem broccoli for 5 minutes.
 7. Serve on top of plain jasmine rice garnished with blanched bean sprouts and fresh coriander.
